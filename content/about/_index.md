#### "I know I am not successful enough, but I am passionate enough not to worry about success"

---

Hello, I'm Ashutosh Kumar Tiwari, a passionate and self-taught programmer and machine learning research aficionado from India. I am currently working as a software developer at Oracle, India. In addition, I am carrying out independent research under the supervision of my university professor. My research interest involves a tight integration of deep reinforcement learning strategies and perception & control of robust autonomous systems. I am also interested in **Continual Learning**, a branch of AI, which aims at teaching machines new concepts over time. The long term goal of my research is to explore the nuances of lifelong learnng in real-world settings of Autonomous machines.


I love programming and being creative with whatever I do.
I also do a lot of **designing** , **painting** and **digital art** with **Music production/Mashups/Remixes**. Take a look at my work below.

Thanks for taking the time to know more about me!
