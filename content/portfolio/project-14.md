#### Project Heads-up

Solving the environment require an average total reward of over **200** on 100 consecutive episodes.If lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward back. Episode finishes if the lander crashes or comes to rest, receiving additional -100 or +100 points. Each leg ground contact is +10. Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Firing side engine is -0.03 points each frame. Landing outside landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.
