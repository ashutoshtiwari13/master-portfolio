#### Project Heads-up

The project creates a [ROS Node](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes) for image segmentation for objects kept on the cluttered table from the `pcd`'s used in the RANSAC plane fitting project above. The setup is run and tested on the RoboND simulator Environment provided by Udacity. The segmentation has been visualized in `Rviz` by selecting the `/pcl_objects` topic.
A successful implementation of the cluster based segmentation using [Voxel Grid filtering](https://python-pcl-fork.readthedocs.io/en/rc_patches4/tutorial/filtering.html#downsampling-a-pointcloud-using-a-voxelgrid-filter) results in assigning a different colour to each custer.

The `Gazebo` setup for the same table top consists of a stick robot with an RBG-D camera attached to its head.
