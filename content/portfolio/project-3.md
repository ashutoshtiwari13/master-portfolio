## Project Heads-up

This project gives the [PR2 robot](https://robots.ieee.org/robots/pr2/) the ability to locate an object in a cluttered environment, pick it up and then move it to some other location. This is an interesting problem to solve and is a challenge at the forefront of the robotics industry today. The project uses a perception pipeline , [here](https://github.com/ashutoshtiwari13/ROS-PCL-Segmentation#Image-Segmentation) and [here](https://github.com/ashutoshtiwari13/ROS-PCL-Segmentation#Object-Recognition-and-Labelling), to identify target objects from a so-called ‚ÄúPick-List‚Äù in that particular order, pick up those objects and place them in corresponding drop-boxes.

Performing image segmentation and object detection are two important parts of the project forming the perception pipeline for the PR2 Robot. The control/Actuator part is handled by calling a `PR2 mover function`, which then calls the `pr2_mover` to pick and place detected objects.
The project deals with three test world scenarios one of whose results is shown in the below image
