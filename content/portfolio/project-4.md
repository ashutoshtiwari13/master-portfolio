## Project Heads-up

SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and mapping) (Nvidia Article [here](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/07/25/what-is-simultaneous-localization-and-mapping-nvidia-jetson-isaac-sdk/)) is a technology where a robot builds a map representing its spatial environment while keeping a track of its position within the built map. Real-time apperance based mapping (RTAB) is RGB-D , stereo , Graph based SLAM approach based on incremental appearance-based loop closure detector. More [here](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/).

This project is about implementing SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and mapping) with RTAB-MAP(Real-Time Appearance-Base Mapping) package. Two 2D occupancy grid and a 3D octomap is created from a simulated environment. The results show the robot successfully localizing and mapping itself in the surrounding.
