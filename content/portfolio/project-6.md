## Project Heads-up

A deep neural network to identify and track a target (person) via a simulated Quadrocopter (Simulated using Udacity QuadSim by Unity). Applications like these are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques are used for tasks of advanced cruise control in UAV's , autonomous vehicles and human-robot collaboration in the industry.
