#### Project Heads-up

The project aims on building a new type of Artificial intelligence algorithm which is simple and surpasses many already available algorithms for Humanoid or Mu-Jo-Co(Multidimensionla-Joint-with-contact) locomotion related tasks. It simulates a powerful AI Algorithm,called Augmented Random Search (ARS) by training a Half-cheetah (Mu-Jo-Co) to walk and run across a field. to walk and run .
