#### Project Heads-up

Python/OpenCV script that detect motion on webcam and allow record it to a file and plot a graph for proper Visualization.
The trivial idea is to compute the difference between two frames apply a threshold the separate pixels that have changed from the others and then count all the black pixels. Then the average is calculated with this count and the total number of pixels and depending of the ceil the event is triggered or NOT.
