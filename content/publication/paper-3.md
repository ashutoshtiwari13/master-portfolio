#### Paper details

Presented at 11th International Conference on Educational Data Mining , Buffalo, New York, US, 2018.

Learning & development (L&D) is an important strategic factor for sustainable business growth of any organization. L&D has become an integral part of an organization, considering the fast-paced growth of industries. Success of learning and development program depends on how well it identifies the critical skill gaps in its workforce and bridges those gaps by considering individual learner's strengths and aspirations while recommending learning opportunities. Such recommendation requires a rich information about learners and learning opportunities. In this paper, we propose a framework that recommends learning opportunities to learners based on their preferences. We also propose a way to connect users of similar interests on the platform to improve course engagement. We developed a conversational AI agent that assist the learner in their journey. We evaluated our approach on the dataset consisting of 5,000 learners, and 49,202 courses. Our approach performed significantly better than the baseline approach.
