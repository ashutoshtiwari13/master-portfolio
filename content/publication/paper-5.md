#### Paper details
Under Review in Robotics adn Autonomous Systems (RAS), Elsevier Journals

- Trained a Robotic Arm to pick up and get a stable grip on an non-deformabale arbitrary object.
- Developed an RL model exploring PPO, DDPG by varying different feature learning methods and custom input structures
- Evaluated speed performance in training time (~50,000 episodes) and achieved overall accuracy (~70%) with PPO trained on a
combination of random features from a fixed CNN and feature vectors
